In certain instances, a buyer may be responsible for the cost of return shipping for an item returned
to a seller. If the buyer is responsible for the return shipping costs, the buyer may elect to use an
eBay-generated shipping label or purchase a shipping label directly from a carrier. By choosing to use
an eBay-generated shipping label, you (as a buyer) agree that eBay may deduct the cost of the
shipping label from the refund owed to you. eBay Money Back Guarantee
Most eBay sales go smoothly, but if there's a problem with a purchase covered by eBay Money Back
Guarantee, buyers can get their money back if an item didn't arrive, is faulty or damaged, or doesn't
match the listing. You agree to comply with the policy and permit us to make a final decision on any
eBay Money Back Guarantee case. If you (as seller) choose to reimburse a buyer, or are required to reimburse a buyer or eBay under the
eBay Money Back Guarantee, eBay or eBay Payments Entities may invoice you in the amount of the
reimbursement, or collect the amount of the reimbursement from you as described in the Payments
Terms of Use. If we cannot get reimbursement from you, we may collect the outstanding sums using
other collection mechanisms, including retaining collection agencies. We may suspend the eBay Money Back Guarantee in whole or in part without notice if we suspect
abuse or interference with the proper working of the policy. You agree to make us whole for any
losses, including expenses we incur to recoup such losses, arising out of your abuse of the eBay
Money Back Guarantee, or any fraud you commit in connection with the eBay Money Back
Guarantee.
