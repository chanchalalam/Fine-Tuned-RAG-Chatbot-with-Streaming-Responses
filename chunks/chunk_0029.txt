To be valid, you must personally sign the Notice and complete all information on the
Notice form, including a description of the claims you are asserting, the specific relief sought,
and the user name, email address and phone number associated with your account. The Informal Dispute Resolution process lasts 45 days and is a mandatory precondition to
commencing arbitration. The statute of limitations and any filing deadlines shall be tolled
while the parties engage in Informal Dispute Resolution. 2. Waiver of Jury Trial
YOU AND EBAY HEREBY WAIVE ANY CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN
COURT AND HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and eBay are instead
electing that all Disputes shall be resolved by arbitration under this Agreement to Arbitrate,
except as specified in Section 19.B ("Agreement to Arbitrate"). 3. Waiver of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief
EACH OF US MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND
NOT ON A CLASS, REPRESENTATIVE, OR COLLECTIVE BASIS, AND THE PARTIES HEREBY WAIVE
ALL RIGHTS TO HAVE ANY DISPUTE BE BROUGHT, HEARD, ADMINISTERED, RESOLVED, OR
ARBITRATED ON A CLASS, COLLECTIVE, OR REPRESENTATIVE BASIS. ONLY INDIVIDUAL RELIEF
IS AVAILABLE. Subject to this Agreement to Arbitrate, the arbitrator may award declaratory
or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent
necessary to provide relief warranted by the partyâ€™s individual claim. Nothing in this
paragraph is intended to, nor shall it, affect the terms and conditions under Section 19.B.7
("Batch Arbitration").
