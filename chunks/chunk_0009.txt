In particular, if you
offer or reference your contact information or ask a buyer for their contact information in the context
of buying or selling outside of eBay, you may be liable to pay a final value fee applicable to that item,
even if the item doesn't sell, given your usage of our Services for the introduction to a buyer. You as a seller must have a payment method on file when using our selling Services and pay all fees
and applicable taxes associated with your use of our Services by the payment due date. If your
payment method fails or your account is past due, we may place restrictions on your account, or the
eBay Payments Entities (as defined below) may collect amounts owed in the manner described in the
Payments Terms of Use, and late fees will apply. eBay, or the collection agencies we retain, may also
report information about your account to credit bureaus, and as a result, late payments, missed
payments, or other defaults on your account may be reflected in your credit report. If you wish to
dispute the information eBay reported to a credit bureau (i.e., Experian, Equifax, or TransUnion)
please contact us at eBay Inc., c/o Global Collections, 7700 West Parmer Lane, Building D, Austin, TX
78729. If you wish to dispute the information a collection agency reported to a credit bureau
regarding your eBay account, you must contact the collection agency directly. 7.
