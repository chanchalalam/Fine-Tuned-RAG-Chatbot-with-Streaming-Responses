Batch Arbitration
To increase the efficiency of administration and resolution of arbitrations, you and eBay
agree that in the event that there are 25 or more individual Demands of a substantially
similar nature filed against eBay by or with the assistance of the same law firm, group of law
firms, or organizations ("Claimant’s Counsel"), within a reasonably proximate period of time,
for example, a 90 day period, NAM shall (1) administer the arbitration demands in batches of
100 Demands per batch (or, if between 25 and 99 individual Demands are filed, a single
batch of all those Demands, and, to the extent there are less than 100 Demands remaining
after the batching described above, a final batch consisting of the remaining Demands); (2)
appoint one arbitrator for each batch; and (3) provide for the resolution of each batch on a
consolidated basis with one set of filing and administrative fees due per batch, one
procedural calendar, one hearing (if any) in a place to be selected by Claimant’s Counsel or, if
Claimant’s Counsel does not have a preference, by the arbitrator, and one final award, which
will provide for any and all relief to which the arbitrator determines each individual party is
entitled ("Batch Arbitration"). NAM shall administer all batches concurrently, to the extent
possible. All parties agree that Demands are of a "substantially similar nature" if they arise out of or
relate to the same event or factual scenario and raise the same or similar legal issue(s) and
seek the same or similar relief.
