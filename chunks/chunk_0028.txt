The exceptions to this Agreement to Arbitrate are: (1) you or
eBay may seek relief in small claims court if such claims qualify and remain in small claims court; and
(2) you or eBay may seek equitable relief in court for infringement or other misuse of intellectual
property rights (such as trademarks, trade dress, domain names, trade secrets, copyrights, and
patents). For purposes of this Agreement to Arbitrate, "Dispute" will also include disputes that arose
or involve facts occurring before the existence of this or any prior versions of the User Agreement as
well as claims that may arise after the termination of this User Agreement, unless those disputes
were noticed prior to this User Agreement. 1. Informal Dispute Resolution
If a Dispute arises between you and eBay, eBay is committed to working with you to reach a
prompt, low-cost and mutually reasonable resolution. You and eBay agree to participate in
good faith informal efforts to resolve Disputes before starting an arbitration or initiating an
action in small claims court ("Informal Dispute Resolution"). To initiate Informal Dispute
Resolution, a party must give notice to the other party in writing in a valid Notice of Dispute
("Notice"), which may be downloaded at this link. Such Notice to eBay should be sent by
email to DisputeNotice@eBay.com or regular mail to our offices located at 583 W. eBay Way,
Draper, UT 84020. eBay will send any Notice to you to the physical address we have on file
associated with your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up
to date.
