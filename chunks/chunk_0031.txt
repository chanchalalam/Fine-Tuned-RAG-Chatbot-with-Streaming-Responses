The award of the arbitrator is final and binding upon you and us. Unsatisfied judgments on
the arbitration award may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This User Agreement
evidences a transaction involving interstate commerce; and notwithstanding any other
provision herein with respect to the applicable substantive law, the Federal Arbitration Act, 9
U.S.C. ยง 1 et seq., will govern the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to
Arbitrate and any arbitration, including the procedures governing Batch Arbitration. If Informal Dispute Resolution does not resolve satisfactorily within 45 days after receipt of a
Notice, you and eBay agree that either party shall have the right to finally resolve the Dispute
through binding arbitration. The arbitration will be administered by National Arbitration &
Mediation ("NAM") in accordance with the NAM Comprehensive Dispute Resolution Rules
and Procedure (the "NAM Comprehensive Rules") in effect at the time of arbitration, except
as supplemented, where applicable, by the NAM Supplemental Rules for Mass Arbitration
Filings (the "NAM Mass Filing Rules"; together with the NAM Comprehensive Rules, the
"NAM Rules"), and as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The NAM Rules are currently
available at https://www.namadr.com/resources/rules-fees-forms/. If NAM is unavailable to
administer the arbitration, another administrator will be selected by the parties or, if the
parties cannot reach agreement, the court (pursuant to Section 19.C below) shall select the
administrator. A party who wishes to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a demand for
arbitration (the "Demand"). A Demand to eBay should be sent by mail to eBay Inc., Attn:
Litigation Department, 583 W. eBay Way, Draper, UT 84020.
