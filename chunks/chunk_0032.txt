If eBay initiates an arbitration
against you, it will send a Demand to the physical address we have on file associated with
your eBay account; it is your responsibility to keep your physical address up to date. A
Demand form is available on NAM's site at
https://www.namadr.com/content/uploads/2024/09/Revised-Comprehensive-Demand-for-
Arb-9.17.24.pdf. The Demand must include: (1) the name, telephone number, mailing
address, e-mail address, and eBay user name of the party seeking arbitration, including a
statement whether the party is a U.S. resident; (2) a statement of the legal claims being
asserted and the factual bases for those claims; (3) a description of the remedy sought and
an accurate, good-faith calculation of the amount in controversy; (4) a statement certifying
completion of the Informal Dispute Resolution process as described above; and (5) a
statement certifying that the requesting party will pay any necessary filing fees in connection
with such arbitration. If the party requesting arbitration is represented by counsel, the
Demand shall also include counselâ€™s name, telephone number, mailing address, and email
address. Such counsel must also sign the Demand. If you are a U.S. resident, and unless you and eBay otherwise agree, the arbitration, including
any in-person arbitration hearing, will be conducted in the county where you reside or, in the
case of Batch Arbitration, as determined by the arbitrator. If you are not a resident of the
United States, then the arbitration, including any in-person arbitration hearing, will be held
in Salt Lake County, Utah, United States, or another mutually agreed location. Subject to the
NAM Rules, the arbitrator may direct a limited and reasonable exchange of information
between the parties, consistent with the expedited nature of the arbitration.
