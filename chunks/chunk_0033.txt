You and eBay
agree that all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings shall
be kept confidential and shall not be shared with anyone except the parties’ attorneys,
accountants, or business advisors, and shall be subject to the condition that they agree to
keep all materials and documents exchanged during the arbitration proceedings confidential. You and eBay agree that at least 14 days before the date set for an arbitration hearing, any
party may serve an offer in writing upon the other party to allow judgment on specified
terms. If the offer made by one party is not accepted by the other party, and the other party
fails to obtain a more favorable award, the other party shall not recover any post-offer costs
to which they otherwise would be entitled and shall pay the offering party’s costs from the
time of the offer. The parties agree that the arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance
with applicable law, including recognized principles of equity, and will honor all claims of
privilege recognized by law. The parties agree that the arbitrator shall not be bound by
rulings in prior arbitrations involving different users but shall be bound by rulings in prior
arbitrations involving the same eBay user to the extent required by applicable law. The
arbitrator's award shall be final and binding, and an unsatisfied judgment on the award
rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. 5. Arbitrator
The arbitrator will be either a retired judge or an attorney and will be selected by the parties
from the NAM’s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators, provided that if the Batch Arbitration
process is triggered, NAM will appoint the arbitrator for each batch without soliciting input
or feedback from any party.
