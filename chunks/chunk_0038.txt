You must complete, sign, and mail that to us to opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. You
must sign the Opt-Out Notice for it to be effective. Any Opt-Out Notice will be effective only
if you send it yourself, on an individual basis, and opt-out notices from any third party
purporting to act on your behalf will have no effect on your or eBayâ€™s rights. This procedure is
the only way you can opt out of this Agreement to Arbitrate. Opting out of this Agreement to Arbitrate has no effect on any arbitration agreement(s) you
may currently have with us, including any previous version of this Agreement to Arbitrate to
which you agreed; all such prior arbitration agreements remain in effect unless superseded
by this Agreement, and you cannot use this procedure to opt out of any previous version of
this Agreement to Arbitrate. Neither you nor eBay waives any right to arbitration that may
apply to any current or pending lawsuit, arbitration, or legal proceeding commenced prior to
the effective date of this Agreement to Arbitrate. If you opt out of this Agreement to
Arbitrate, all other parts of this User Agreement and its Legal Disputes section will continue
to apply to you. 10. Future Amendments to the Agreement to Arbitrate
Notwithstanding any provision in the User Agreement to the contrary, you and we agree that
if we make any amendment to this Agreement to Arbitrate (other than an amendment to
any notice address or site link provided herein) in the future, that amendment shall not
apply to any claim already filed in arbitration (or, where permitted, in court or small claims
court) against eBay prior to the effective date of the amendment.
