The purchase of a vehicle encompasses multiple disciplines and eBay is not an expert on matters
such as vehicle market valuation, laws relating to vehicles, taxes relating to vehicles, vehicle
financing, vehicle registration, vehicle insurance, vehicle condition safety, and inspections, or vehicle
mechanical fitness and engineering, eBay hereby cautions you, and you understand and
acknowledge, that you should seek professional expert assistance and advice in these and other
areas of professional expertise as appropriate. 5. Policy Enforcement
When a buyer or seller issue arises, we may consider the user's performance history and the specific
circumstances in applying our policies. We may choose to be more lenient with policy enforcement
in an effort to do the right thing for both buyers and sellers. The foregoing does not limit or impair
our right to refuse, modify, or terminate all or part of our Services to anyone, or to terminate this
agreement with anyone, for any reason at our discretion. 6. Fees and Taxes
We charge sellers for the use of our Services. In some cases, where buyers receive supplemental
Services such as authentication or storage Services for items in certain categories, we may also
charge those buyers for such supplemental Services. The fees we charge sellers for using our Services to sell goods and services are listed on our Selling
fees pages. We may change our selling fees from time to time by posting the changes on the eBay
site fourteen (14) days in advance, but with no advance notice required for temporary promotions or
any changes that result in the reduction of fees. If you are a seller, you are liable for fees arising out of all sales made using some or all of our
Services, even if sales terms are finalized or payment is made outside of eBay.
