by the eBay Payment Entity from you will satisfy your obligations to pay the seller in the
amount of payments received;
• In certain instances, your transaction may be declined, frozen, or held for any reason
including for suspected fraud, Anti-Money Laundering ("AML") compliance, compliance with
economic or trade sanctions, in connection with eBay's internal risk controls or due to
potential violations of any policy of eBay or the eBay Payment Entity, or a policy of one of the
Payment Entity's third-party payment services providers;
• eBay, the eBay Payment Entity or its affiliates may save payment information, such as credit
card or debit card numbers, and card expiration dates, entered by you on our Services when
you make a purchase, redeem a coupon, or make any other transaction on our Services

default payment method for future transactions on our Services. At any time, you can update
your card information or enter new card information, at which point the new card
information shall be stored as your default payment method. You may make changes to your
default payment method through the payment section in My eBay. You are responsible for
maintaining the accuracy of information we have on file, and you consent to eBay updating
such stored information from time to time based on information provided by you, your bank
or other payments services providers. You will only provide information about payment
methods that you are authorized to use.
