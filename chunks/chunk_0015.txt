One of the ways we make eBay.com listings available to international buyers is through the eBay
International Shipping Program ("EIS"). EIS enables buyers to obtain parcel processing, international
shipping, and customs clearance services. It is facilitated by eBay through third-party service
providers that eBay has contracted with to operationalize the program. By listing your item on
eBay.com you agree to the EIS Terms and Conditions. If you choose not to participate in EIS, you can
opt out of the program by updating your shipping preferences. 10. Content
