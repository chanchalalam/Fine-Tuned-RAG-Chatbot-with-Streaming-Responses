Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement to Arbitrate, if a final decision,
not subject to any further appeal or recourse, determines that the limitations of this Section
are invalid or unenforceable as to a particular claim or request for relief (such as a request
for public injunctive relief), you and eBay agree that that particular claim or request for relief
(and only that particular claim or request for relief) shall be severed from the arbitration and
may be brought in court (pursuant to Section 19.C below), subject to your and eBay's right to
appeal the court's decision. All other Disputes, aside from those explicitly exempted in
Sections 19.B (above), shall be arbitrated. This section does not prevent you or eBay from
participating in a class-wide settlement of claims. 4. Arbitration Procedures
Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator
instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration award is very limited. However,
an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individualized basis that a court
can award to an individual. An arbitrator will apply the terms of the User Agreement as a
court would. The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any Dispute, including,
without limitation, disputes regarding the interpretation or application of the Agreement to
Arbitrate, including the enforceability, revocability, scope, or validity of the Agreement to
Arbitrate or any portion of the Agreement to Arbitrate, except that all Disputes regarding
Section 19.B.3 ("Waiver of Class and Other Non-Individualized Relief") including any claim
that all or part of that Section is unenforceable, illegal, void or voidable, or that such Section
has been breached, shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction and not by an
arbitrator.
