To the extent the parties disagree on the application of the
Batch Arbitration process, the disagreeing party shall advise NAM, and NAM shall appoint a
sole standing Procedural Arbitrator or, should the circumstances so require, an Emergency
Arbitrator, according to the NAM Rules, to determine the applicability of the Batch
Arbitration process (the Procedural Arbitrator or Emergency Arbitrator, the "Administrative
Arbitrator"). To expedite resolution of any such dispute by the Administrative Arbitrator, the
parties agree the Administrative Arbitrator may set forth such procedures as are necessary to
resolve any disputes promptly. The Administrative Arbitratorâ€™s fees shall be paid by eBay. You and eBay agree to cooperate in good faith with NAM to implement the Batch Arbitration
process including the payment of single filing and administrative fees for batches of
Demands, as well as any steps to minimize the time and costs of arbitration, which may
include: (1) the appointment of a discovery special master to assist the arbitrator in the
resolution of discovery disputes; and (2) the adoption of an expedited calendar of the
arbitration proceedings. This Batch Arbitration provision shall in no way be interpreted as
authorizing a class, collective and/or representative arbitration or action of any kind, except
as expressly set forth in this provision, and nothing about the Batch Arbitration process will
preclude any party from participating in any arbitration administered according to that
process. 8.
