If the parties are unable to agree upon an arbitrator within 35
days of delivery of the Demand, then NAM will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the
NAM Rules. 6. Fees and Costs
Payment of all filing, administration, and arbitrator fees will be governed by the applicable
NAM fee schedules (the "Fee Schedules"), but may be reapportioned between the parties in
accordance with this Agreement to Arbitrate, as follows: if you complied with the Informal
Dispute Resolution requirements in Section 1 of this Agreement and the value of the relief
sought in the Dispute is $10,000 or less, at your request eBay will pay all filing,
administration, and arbitrator fees associated with the arbitration. The parties shall bear
their own attorneys’ fees and costs in arbitration unless the arbitrator finds that either the
substance of the Dispute or the relief sought in the Demand was frivolous or was brought for
an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil
Procedure 11(b)). To the extent, following a presentation on the merits, on its own motion or
a party’s, and after affording a reasonable opportunity to respond, an arbitrator determines
that a party who commenced arbitration did not bring its claim(s) consistent with counsel’s
Certification and the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b), the
arbitrator may, as part of its award, impose sanctions by ordering that the initiating party
reimburse the responding party for all arbitration costs and arbitrators’ fees the responding
party incurred under the Fee Schedule. 7.
