For all new sellers, in listings where returns are accepted, eBay will set a default rule that automates
the return process. Sellers may remove or customize their return preferences in their account
settings within My eBay. Where settings have been set to automatically accept requests for returns
or replacements, an eBay-generated return shipping label will be provided to your buyer. You agree
to comply with our returns policy. When an item is returned or if a transaction is canceled after payment has been completed, eBay
may issue a refund to the buyer on the seller's behalf and charge the seller for the amount of the
refund. Additionally, eBay may charge sellers for the cost of return shipping labels and/or other reasonable
fees from sellers when:
• An eBay-generated return shipping label is used, and the seller is responsible for its cost;
• Returns have been automated;
• The seller fails to send the buyer a return shipping label and, instead, an eBay-generated
shipping label is used; and/or
• The item is not as described in the listing and is returned in accordance with eBay Money
Back Guarantee or other applicable terms. eBay or eBay Payment Entities may invoice sellers for these charges and collect such charges as
described in the Payments Terms of Use. All seller cancellations of orders must be in accordance with our Order cancellation policy. Returns and cancellations for buyers
Buyers generally do not have the right to cancel an order. Buyers can request to cancel an order on
eBay within the time period and as provided in our Order cancellation policy, and the seller will have
3 days to accept or decline the request. If the order cannot be canceled, buyers may still be
permitted to return the item if the item is eligible for return.
