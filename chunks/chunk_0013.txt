Purchase Conditions
When buying an item using our Services, you agree to the Rules and policies for buyers and that:
• You are responsible for reading the full item listing before making a bid or offer, buying, or
committing to buy;
• You enter into a legally binding contract to purchase an item when you buy the item, commit
to buy the item, your offer for the item is accepted, you have the winning bid for the item, or
your bid for the item is otherwise accepted, regardless of when payment is due or received
unless the transaction terms state that you are required to pay for the item before a binding
contract is formed;
• For motor vehicles and real estate, a bid or offer initiates a non-binding transaction
representing a buyer's serious expression of interest in buying the seller's item and does not
create a formal contract between the buyer and the seller;
• We do not transfer legal ownership of items from the seller to you;
• Utah Code Annotated § 70A-2-401(2) and Uniform Commercial Code § 2-401(2) apply to the
transfer of ownership between the buyer and the seller, unless the buyer and the seller
agree otherwise. 9. International Buying and Selling; Translation
Given the nature of eBay's global marketplace, listings may be viewed and purchased by, and shipped
to, buyers around the world. Many of our Services are accessible internationally. We offer certain
programs, tools, and experiences of particular interest to international sellers and buyers, such as
estimated local currency conversion and international shipping calculation tools.
